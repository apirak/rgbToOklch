# RGB to OKLCH Color Converter

This TypeScript library provides a streamlined solution for converting RGB
colors directly to the OKLCH color space without the overhead of larger
libraries like `culori`. It is ideal for applications where a lightweight,
focused utility is needed for color conversion, particularly useful for
developers working with color manipulation in environments where minimal
dependency overhead is desired.

## Features

- Convert RGB directly to OKLCH without external dependencies.
- Handle conversion through intermediary color spaces (sRGB Linear, XYZ, and
  Oklab) with precision.
- Small footprint, ideal for projects where only color conversion is needed
  without additional color science tools.

## Usage

```typescript
import { colorToOKLCH, RGB } from 'rgbToOklch';

const rgb: RGB = { r: 255 / 255, g: 0, b: 0 }; // Red color
const result = colorToOKLCH(rgb, undefined);
console.log(result); // oklch(62.8%, 0.258, 29.2)
```

## Testing

This project uses Jest for its test suite to ensure all conversions are accurate
and reliable. Additionally, we use a specific file named `oklchCulori.ts` which
employs the `culori` library for benchmarking and validation purposes.

### `oklchCulori.ts` - Benchmarking with `culori`

The `oklchCulori.ts` file is used exclusively in the testing environment to
compare the outputs of our RGB to OKLCH conversions with those generated by
`culori`. This helps validate the accuracy of our library against a
well-established color conversion tool.

Here is how `oklchCulori.ts` is utilized:

- **Validation**: It runs similar conversions using `culori` and compares them
  with our results to ensure they match.
- **Benchmarking**: Provides performance and accuracy benchmarks which help in
  optimizing our conversion algorithms.

This file is not included in the production build of the library and is only
used during development to ensure our outputs are correct and reliable.

To run tests, including the validations against `culori`:

```bash
npm test
```

## Additional Details

- **Purpose and Clarity**: The introduction now emphasizes the lightweight
  nature of the library and its purpose of providing a simple conversion tool
  without requiring `culori` or similar comprehensive libraries.
- **Simplified API Descriptions**: The API section briefly explains each
  function, focusing on their role in the conversion pipeline.
- **Installation and Usage**: Straightforward instructions that make it easy to
  get started using the library.

This README should effectively communicate the purpose of your library and guide
new users in integrating it into their projects.
